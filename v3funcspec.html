      <i>Orbital Mechanics & Long-Cycle Hydrodynamics.</i>
      This chapter formalizes how eccentricity, obliquity, and precession modulate tides, currents, ice-lock, and aquifer behavior—providing the astro-hydrologic timing layer of the Codex OS and bridging V3.6 hydrology to V3.8 taxonomy.

      <h2>Continuity from V3.6 (Oceanic Memory & Topography)</h2>
      <p>V3.6 framed submerged/sand-covered Paleolithic waterways—e.g., the Adrar/Khmer corridor in Mauritania—as <b>storage-and-amplifier systems</b> in the planetary water network. V3.7 explains the <b>clockwork</b> behind their activation: orbital cycles that pace sea level, wind belts, and aquifer pressure, determining <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> such hydrologic engineering mattered most.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Earth’s orbital parameters generate slow, predictable changes in incoming solar energy and seasonal contrast. Over <b>10⁴–10⁶ years (ten thousand to one million years)</b>—and into the multi-glacial range—the resulting <b>orbital forcing</b> shapes ice volumes, sea levels, currents, and atmospheric circulation. Codex nodes and corridors appear tuned to these rhythms, not static means.</p>

      Version 3: Geodetic Foundations & Planetary Forensics

      From the moment the first megalith was set in alignment with the solstice horizon, humans were participating in a planetary conversation — one that began long before we arrived.
      
      V3.1 and V3.2 revealed the blueprint. The alignments of pyramids to distant observatory nodes, the star forts that mirrored celestial geometry, and the rainforest hydrology hidden beneath canopy and soil — all of these hinted that early civilizations were not operating on isolated ingenuity. They were reading a forensic record written into the landscape itself.
      
      Nature had already prepared the template:
          •	Hydrological memory embedded in floodplains, deltas, and underground aquifers.
          •	Geodetic markers encoded in mountain ridges, volcanic arcs, and continental seams.
          •	Resonance pathways carried in mineral veins, piezoelectric lattices, and basaltic spines stretching across oceans.
      
      Ancient engineers did not “invent” sustainable intelligence — they decoded it. The pyramids and star forts were not anomalies; they were waypoints in a planetary operating system that blended hydrology, geodesy, and long-cycle climate knowledge into structures capable of enduring tens of thousands of years.
      
      Now, with modern geospatial modeling, orbital datasets, and harmonic analysis, we can read those same planetary fingerprints at scale. We are learning to see what they saw: not just isolated monuments, but nodes in a planetary network, where design was dictated by survival, resonance, and the safe stewardship of water.
      
      Version 3 is where we assemble the base planetary sciences — climatology, tectonics, mineralogical reservoirs, and oceanic memory — to reconstruct that operating system. It is the foundation upon which V4’s hydrological harmonics, V5’s plasma resonance, and V6’s geosocial intelligence will build.
      
      In doing so, we close the gap between ancient forensic knowledge and modern planetary science, unlocking not only a record of human ingenuity, but a global survival model written in stone, soil, and water.
