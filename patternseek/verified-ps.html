    <h2>Track A — Human → AI</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">Meaning isn’t extracted. Participation isn’t coerced. Intelligence begins with agency.</p>

      <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/patternseek/psv1.png" alt="A semantic lattice field showing proportional meaning across multiple models">
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Semantic Lattice Field.</strong> Agreement becomes geometry; uncertainty becomes a bounded gradient.
        PatternSeek aligns scale so differences stay proportional—not binary.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <figure class="ps-figure">
      <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/patternseek/psv2.png" alt="Everyday human interactions with AI emitting semantic signals captured into a shared lattice by consent">
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Points of Contact.</strong> People already generate meaning through search, chat, design, research, and care.
        Verified makes those signals legible—ethically, proportionally, and by choice.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <figure class="ps-figure">
      <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/patternseek/psv3.png" alt="Human insights represented as provenance-linked facets or tokens connected to moments of contribution">
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Tokenizing Meaning.</strong> Units of insight can be registered as provenance-linked artifacts—optional and revocable.
        The point isn’t speculation; it’s traceable contribution.
      </figcaption>

    <figure class="ps-figure">
      <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/patternseek/psv4.png" alt="Individuals connecting to universities, healthcare, government, B2B and B2C through opt-in semantic alignment">
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Discovery by Alignment.</strong> Organizations publish curiosity; individuals opt in where knowledge fits.
        Targeting becomes discovery—reciprocity replaces extraction.
      </figcaption>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Meaning as Intended.</strong> One message meets many models.
        Verified preserves continuity of intent while allowing nuance across interpretation contexts.
      </figcaption>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Calibration Without Ranking.</strong> No winners. No ladders.
        Verified doesn’t decide what’s best—it preserves what’s meant through calibrated pulses.

      <figcaption>
        <strong>From Verified to Studio.</strong> The signal stays human; the tooling deepens.
        Each tier adds capability—not authority.
      </figcaption>

  <section class="ps-card">
    <h2>Track C — System Integrity</h2>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Calibration Without Bias.</strong> Systems are measured for drift, variance, and stability under uncertainty.
        The record stays traceable over time—without judgement icons.
