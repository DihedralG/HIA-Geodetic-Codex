    <h2>What Partner Pulse is</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      Partner Pulse is a pilot framework for institutions, sponsors, studios, and research teams
      to engage opt-in participants through a lightweight daily “Calibration Pulse.”
      It produces primary research signals that are consent-driven, replayable, and bias-aware —
      without turning participants into targets.
    </p>

    <ul class="ps-triad">
      <li><strong>Opt-in by design</strong> — participants choose what to share, and what persists.</li>
      <li><strong>Calibration, not enforcement</strong> — no “truth score,” no ranking, no gatekeeping.</li>
      <li><strong>Provenance-ready</strong> — outputs can be tied to CDI diffs and traceable assets.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="ps-section">
    <h2>Why partners use it</h2>
    <div class="ps-grid">
      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Better primary research</h3>
        <p>
          Replace passive analytics with real signals: what people found meaningful, what changed their view,
          and what they want to explore next — captured with consent.
        </p>
        <p class="ps-note"><strong>Outcome:</strong> insight you can defend, not just clicks you can count.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Bias-aware testing</h3>
        <p>
          Prompt design can be moderated to reduce leading questions, push-polling,
          and response conditioning — while preserving disagreement and uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p class="ps-note"><strong>Outcome:</strong> cleaner signal, less manipulation risk.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Replayable calibration</h3>
        <p>
          Run the same pulse loop across different cohorts or time windows and compare drift,
          variance, and boundary stability — without turning people into a scoreboard.
        </p>
        <p class="ps-note"><strong>Outcome:</strong> continuity you can measure over time.</p>

  <section class="ps-section">
    <h2>What participants do</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      Participants complete a short, optional check-in (~30 seconds).
      They select touchpoints like Information, Work, Learning, Recreation, and Discovery —
      then optionally choose a pathway: Share Insight, Discover Something New, or Submit Pulse.
    </p>

    <div class="ps-grid">
      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Share Insight</h3>
        <p>
          A short reflection — what mattered, what changed, what felt true, or what felt off.
          This is where nuance lives.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Discover Something New</h3>
        <p>
          Participant-led discovery loops: curated prompts, sample sets, and sponsor-supported “tries”
          that feel like offers — not targeting.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Submit Pulse</h3>
        <p>
          A low-friction option: contribute a signal without writing. Participation remains lightweight.
        </p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p class="ps-note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> PatternSeek doesn’t watch people.
      It listens when they choose to share — and makes it worth the time.

    <h2>Integration posture</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      Partner Pulse is designed to integrate with future commercial, studio, and institutional systems —
      allowing verified semantic assets, calibration events, and CDI updates to synchronize via API as ecosystems evolve.
    </p>

    <ul class="ps-triad">
      <li><strong>We don’t replace your systems.</strong> We synchronize with what you already have — selectively, consensually, and proportionally.</li>
      <li><strong>Bring your assets.</strong> Prompts, rubrics, datasets, creative tests, evaluation harnesses, or research instruments.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep it lightweight.</strong> Public-facing pages remain simple while deeper integrations happen behind Verified API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pilot formats</h2>
    <div class="ps-grid">
      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Discovery Pilots</h3>
        <p>
          Test a catalog (content, products, destinations, learning paths) with opt-in participants
          and measure what actually resonates — beyond engagement metrics.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Meaning Drift Audits</h3>
        <p>
          Track definitional stability and semantic drift across time, versions, and context —
          especially when interpretations impact policy, safety, or public understanding.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>Calibration Cohorts</h3>
        <p>
          Convene small groups for moderated prompting and structured feedback loops —
          designed to preserve nuance, not force consensus.
        </p>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>No surveillance analytics</h3>
        <p>Partner Pulse is opt-in. It is not behavioral tracking and it is not an attention marketplace.</p>

        <h3>No ranking people</h3>
        <p>We avoid winner/loser mechanics and “scoreboard” incentives that corrupt participation.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>No forced consensus</h3>
        <p>Disagreement is preserved. Calibration makes it visible and navigable — not suppressed.</p>

      If you want to run a pilot (research, culture, education, public interest, studio testing),
      we’ll help structure a consent-driven Pulse loop and connect it to your existing assets.
