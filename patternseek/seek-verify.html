    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      PatternSeek is about <strong>meaning + behavior under uncertainty</strong> — not control, ranking, or surveillance.
      Seek &amp; Verify is an opt-in program for people who want to share small, truthful signals about how meaning
      moves through a day: what they touched, what resonated, and what they’d like to explore next.
    </p>

    <ul class="ps-triad">
      <li><strong>Opt-in</strong> — participation is voluntary, and sharing is selective.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-extractive</strong> — no “truth scores,” no gamification, no coercion.</li>
      <li><strong>Proportional</strong> — nuance stays nuanced; uncertainty stays bounded.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="ps-section">
    <h2>Reciprocity (the point)</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      Reciprocity is more than “feedback.” It’s the idea that when you choose to share a small signal,
      the system should return something useful: relevance, clarity, discovery, or a better question.
      A Pulse isn’t just measurement — it’s a lightweight way to help individuals, families, and communities
      <strong>redirect energy toward what’s meaningful</strong>, and away from noise.
    </p>

    <p class="ps-note">
      PatternSeek doesn’t watch you. It listens when you choose to share — and makes that exchange worth the time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="ps-section">
    <h2>The Daily Calibration Pulse</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      A calm, optional check-in designed to feel reflective — closer to a wellness moment than a survey.
      No numbers. No ranking. No “performance.”

        <h3>What participants do</h3>
        <p>
          Select touchpoints like Information, Work, Learning, Entertainment, and Discovery —
          then optionally choose a simple pathway: share insight, discover something new, or calibrate a pulse.

        <h3>What participants get</h3>
        <p>
          More relevant discovery, better questions, and clearer context — without the pressure of “agree/disagree”
          binaries. The goal is to make meaning stable enough to be examined over time.
        </p>

      <article class="ps-card">
        <h3>What remains true</h3>
        <p>
          No tracking-first design. No hidden extraction. No ranking ladder.
          Calibration is measurement; interpretation stays human and contextual.

    <h2>How this connects to partners</h2>
    <p class="ps-intro">
      Seek &amp; Verify is designed to integrate with future commercial, studio, and institutional systems —
      allowing verified semantic assets, calibration events, and CDI updates to synchronize via API as ecosystems evolve.
    </p>

    <ul class="ps-triad">
      <li><strong>We don’t replace your systems.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>We synchronize with what you already have</strong> — selectively, consensually, and proportionally.</li>
      <li><strong>We keep the public layer lightweight</strong>, while enabling deeper calibration where it’s needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps-note">
      The semantics of life are important enough to track over time — not to control people,
      but to preserve meaning, reduce drift, and move closer to what we seek (and can verify).
    </p>

    <p class="ps-core">
      We don’t decide what’s true.<br/>
      We make meaning stable enough to be examined.

    <p class="ps-note">
      Interested in pilots, sponsorships, or dataset calibration partnerships?
      We’ll start small, run clean experiments, and publish learnings proportionally.
