      <h2>🛠️ Field Stewardship & Sacred Preservation</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of ChiR Labs and the Geodetic Codex is grounded not only in high-resolution data modeling,
        but also in reverence for the physical remnants of ancient intelligence — the stoneworks, terraces,
        and hydrological systems that continue to  reflect truths long buried beneath soil, forest, and glacier.
        These sites, when viewed through lidar-enhanced analysis and comparative elevation patterning, reveal harmonic relationships that bridge both science and memory — connecting us to ancestral timelines long unrecognized by modern frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        While lidar, DEM tiles, and statistical models offer clarity from above, it is the work of field
        researchers, local stewards, and boots-on-ground archaeologists that makes these discoveries real,
        contextual, and accountable. These embedded truths, shaped by human hands and planetary cycles,
        deserve both preservation and reinterpretation — especially when they defy linear historical timelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        We approach this endeavor humbly, yet with confidence in the patterns. When a site echoes across
        azimuths, elevation grades, and cosmological alignments, we do not declare finality — we invite
        inquiry. This is not about rewriting history for attention, but listening more deeply to what has
        already been carved, aligned, mirrored, and remembered.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you or your organization are engaged in restoration, field documentation, or preservation of
        ancient sites — whether mapped or newly uncovered — we welcome collaboration. Contact us via
        <a href="chir-ai.html">ChiR-AI</a> to share data, coordinate teams, or propose a site for peer-reviewed
        Codex integration.

      <h2>🌱 Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>This project is early-stage, grassroots, and intentionally non-commercial. We believe scientific truth, planetary protection, and ethical intelligence systems must be publicly trusted—not paywalled. If you value this mission, consider helping us build it.</p>
