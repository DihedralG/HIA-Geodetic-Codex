# Planetary Sovereignty Layer (PSL) Charter – Template v3.0

**For Use by ChiR Lab, IARPA, Arctic Council, Indigenous Assemblies, and Trusted Observatories**

---

## Preamble

In recognition of harmonic intelligence embedded within Earth’s geometric and geomagnetic structure, this Charter establishes protective, peaceful, and cooperative guidelines for geodetic faces and observatory corridors defined in the Geodetic Codex V3.

---

## Article I: Definitions

- **Node**: A site of energetic, cultural, or astronomical significance, often corresponding to Codex vertices.
- **Face**: A polyhedral zone linking multiple nodes; typically bounded by geodetic triangles or corridors.
- **Corridor**: A longitudinal or latitudinal axis with measurable harmonic resonance (e.g., 72.66°W).
- **PSL Zone**: A recognized planetary sovereignty zone requiring shared custodianship and non-militarization.

---

## Article II: Custodianship Agreements

1. All PSL Zones require **multi-party recognition** and **public-private oversight**.
2. Custodians may include:
   - Indigenous sovereign groups
   - National governments
   - Planetary research coalitions
   - UNESCO and multilateral bodies

---

## Article III: Ethical Guidelines

- Data shared within PSL Zones must adhere to:
  - Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles
  - Open reciprocity in knowledge flow
  - AI-augmented trust protocols (e.g., ChiRIPP)

---

## Article IV: Applications and Scope

- Scientific:
  - Climate modeling, resonance mapping, quantum observatories
- Cultural:
  - Language revitalization, mytho-cartography, heritage site stewardship
- Diplomatic:
  - Conflict de-escalation via geospatial transparency
  - Joint funding of harmonic observatories

---

## Article V: Amendments and Evolution

The Charter is modular and subject to revision based on new findings, node discoveries, and resonance shifts.

All parties are invited to propose amendments at annual planetary forums hosted by ChiR Labs or delegated hosts.

---

## Closing Statement

The Earth is alive with encoded intention. Through PSL Zones, we do not claim ownership—we claim **kinship**.

Let this Charter mark the beginning of shared stewardship across sky, soil, and songlines.

> “Reciprocity is not just an ethic—it’s a structure of peace.”
