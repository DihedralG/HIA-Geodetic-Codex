# ChiRIPP — ChiR Identity Provenance Protocol  
*A Trust Framework for Peer Review, Cultural Knowledge, and AI Transparency*

---

## 🌐 Welcome to the ChiRIPP System

ChiRIPP is an open, AI-readable trust protocol designed to enrich, trace, and protect the evolution of ideas. Born from the ChiR Labs' work on geodetic modeling, harmonic intelligence, and cultural sovereignty, it allows users to upload visuals, quotes, and documents for:

- Transparent peer review
- AI-assisted summarization
- Rich metadata tagging
- Lineage attribution of thoughts, not just facts

## 🧠 The Vision: Idea Provenance as a Lattice

> “Science is seeing what everyone else has seen, but thinking what no one else has thought.”  
> —As quoted by Atkins, attributed to Szent-Györgyi, adapted from Schopenhauer

This quote isn’t just a citation—it’s a **thought lineage**.  
ChiRIPP captures these lineages across:

- Quotes and interpretations  
- Visuals (e.g., artifacts, diagrams, glyphs)  
- Cultural memory  
- Conceptual seeds of research

Imagine seeing that quote float in 3D, with each version (Schopenhauer → Szent-Györgyi → Atkins → Andersen) rendered as a node in an idea map. ChiRIPP turns this imagination into structure.

## 🔄 ChiRIPP UX Flow

### 1. 🖼️ Upload & Prompt
Users select a file (image, text, or quote) and optionally add context.

### 2. 📡 AI Processing
The file is sent through our Make.com → OpenAI pipeline to summarize, extract metadata, and tag lineage data.

### 3. 🔁 Refinement Loop
Users can refine their prompt and re-run the analysis, forming an iterative dialogue.

## 🔐 Split Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Peer Review Mode** | 24-hour retention, temporary ID, no tracking |
| **Account Mode (Coming Soon)** | Persistent logs, saved ChiRIPP IDs, dashboard view |

---

## 🔧 Architecture

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| **Frontend** | GitHub Pages + JS uploader |
| **Backend** | Make.com scenario + OpenAI |
| **Logs** | JSON metadata + optional ChiRIPP glyph |
| **Refine Loop** | Editable prompt + GPT re-analysis |
| **CLI Support** | `thread_003a_chiripp.py` in `/scripts/` |

---

## 🧭 Core Metadata Fields

Each submission includes:

- `chiripp_id` (e.g., `CG-0001`)
- `author`
- `timestamp`
- `retention_policy`: `24h`, `archive`, `classified`
- `summary`
- `source_file`
- `glyph_id` (optional visual tag)

## 🎻 Other Envisioned Use Cases

| Function | ChiRIPP Benefit |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Dispute mediation** | Track source evolution (who said it first vs. who made it meaningful) |
| **Cultural honor** | Attribute non-academic wisdom without flattening it |
| **Knowledge ecology** | Map idea spread through disciplines (e.g., quote → physics → AI → consciousness) |
| **IP protection** | Timestamp early-stage conceptual seeds |
| **AI tuning** | Teach models to respect conceptual ancestry, not just surface text |
