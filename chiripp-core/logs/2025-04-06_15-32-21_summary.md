# Metadata Summary

## Key Observations
The metadata payload contains seven key-value pairs. The data seems to be related to a file, possibly an image, given the presence of a file name and a glyph overlay position. The author of the file is Glenn C. Andersen. The file appears to have been created or modified with the help of AI, as indicated by the `ai_contribution` value of 0.25.

## Dataset Attributes
- **hash**: A unique identifier for the data, in this case, "sample123hashvalue".
- **timestamp_utc**: The date and time the data was created or last modified, in this case, "2025-04-05T12:00:00.000Z".
- **author**: The person who created or last modified the data, in this case, "Glenn C. Andersen".
- **ai_contribution**: The proportion of the data created or modified by an AI, in this case, 0.25.
- **original_file**: The name of the original file, in this case, "a1-detail.png".
- **glyph_overlay_position**: The position of a glyph overlay on the file, in this case, "bottom-right".
- **version**: The version of the software used to create or modify the data, in this case, "ChiRIPP v1.0".

## Irregularities or Notable Patterns
There are no apparent irregularities in the metadata. However, it's worth noting that the `ai_contribution` value suggests that a quarter of the work on the file was done by an AI. This could be significant depending on the context.
