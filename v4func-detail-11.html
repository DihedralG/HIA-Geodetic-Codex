    <h2>🌍 Geodetic Codex Version 4 – Hydrological Harmonics & Planetary Resonance Addendum</h2>
    <p>Quartz is revealed as a planetary-scale conductor — used in ignition chambers, phase-control layers, and vibrational tuning zones across multiple Codex nodes. </p>
    <p>
    This release consists of 12 interlocking modules, each mapping a specific resonance layer through water, fire, quartz, memory, or engineering intelligence. The framework builds on the ChiRhombant constant (G = V × H²), integrating planetary survival design with geodetic observatory modeling.

    <h2>🔷  V4.11 –  Kinetic Tools & Flow-Based Stoneworking</h2>
   <p> Evidence mounts for water-pressurized kinetic systems used in carving, channeling, and lifting stone — through harmonic valves, siphons, and downward flow turbines.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <p> Version 4.11 introduces a harmonically attuned interpretation of ancient kinetic systems — technologies that harnessed water pressure, glacial melt, and gravity-fed flow to sculpt, shape, or move stone. Moving beyond speculative narratives of anti-gravity or lost magic, this update offers a grounded mechanical hypothesis:</p>
    

    <p><strong>Key Findings: </strong></p>
    <p> We identify spatial ratios consistent with pressurized aqueducts, siphon chambers, and spillway accelerators at multiple Codex nodes.</p>
      <p>Sites such as Gunung Padang, Machu Picchu, and Meadow House Observatory show signs of buried flow basins and downward vectoring geometry, suggesting stone was carved or channeled in vertical pulses.</p>
      <p> V-shaped channels and radial drains may have concentrated hydraulic energy into repetitive kinetic motion — analogous to water hammers, ancient turbines, or cyclical release valves.</p>
      <p>This version proposes that many megalithic sites were not simply built once but refined over multiple epochs using localized, water-driven melt-shaping techniques. By modeling these flows through the Codex geometry, we begin reverse-engineering an elegant planetary system of kinetic resource use and environmental shaping.</p>

      <h2>🧱 Modular Expansion</h2>
      <p>Version 4 modules are stackable and interoperable, supporting comparative synthesis with planetary models, marine echo structures, and cultural occupation layers.</p>
