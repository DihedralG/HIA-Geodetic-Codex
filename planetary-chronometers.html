        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
          <p>
            Planetary Chronometers frames certain bowl-like basins and saddle geometries as heliolunar chronometers:
            landscape “registers” that bound seasonal solar bearings, lunar standstill envelopes, and glacial/hydrologic
            release timing. Version 2.0 formalizes the global geometry and introduces a reproducible screening rule
            (G = v · h²) for ranking candidate basins. The v2.1–v2.3 addendum extends the model with previously
            unpublished Vermont evidence, using deglacial paleolake systems as a controlled laboratory for replication
            and falsification testing.

        <h2>What’s New (v2.1–v2.3 Addendum)</h2>
        <p>
          The addendum is intentionally <strong>additive</strong>: it does not restate the full global framework, but
          introduces new Vermont-centered evidence and a tighter falsification plan. The purpose is to show that the
          chronometer behavior can replicate within a single glaciated landscape, clarify causal ordering (deglaciation →
          hydrology → later human reuse), and establish Vermont as a field lab for independent testing.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Vermont Deglacial Ignition Band:</strong> Meadow House Observatory (MHO) is positioned within a coherent
            melt-routing / “ignition” band associated with Paleo–Lake Winooski, extending north into Passumpsic paleolakes
            and south toward the Lake Hitchcock system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Replication Logic:</strong> Multiple short-lived paleolakes at comparable latitudes share repeatable
            lithologic and geometric constraints (quartz-rich metamorphic ridges; saddle-controlled basin outlets).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meridian as Constraint, not Cause:</strong> The 72.66°W corridor is presented as a discovery constraint
            (a control line for search + comparison), not an explanatory mechanism by itself.

            <strong>New falsifiable predictions:</strong> δ¹⁸O variance constraints, cosmogenic exposure-age differentials,

      <section id="model">
        <h2>1 — Core Model (v2.0)</h2>
        <p>
          The v2.0 manuscript formalizes the <strong>Quartz Conic Resonance Hypothesis</strong>: quartz-bearing bowls act as
          heliolunar chronometers whose solstitial notches bound a local conic field with a bisector (often ~west for
          west-facing chronometers). Quartz is not framed as “creating” melt energy; rather, it biases timing via thermal
          inertia, piezoelectric feedback, and acoustic transduction — selecting first-melt pathways and sustaining
          perennial spring regimes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The v2.0 package also includes a reproducibility kit: apex/notch centroids and rays (GeoJSON/KML), a horizon-aware
          azimuth calculator, field acoustics protocol (0.5–100 Hz), hydrology logging templates (including δ¹⁸O/δD), and
          a lithology scoring rubric.

        <h2>2 — Vermont Deglacial Hydrochronometry Lab</h2>
        <p>
          Vermont is treated as a compact, testable landscape where chronometer predictions can be replicated and falsified.
          During late Pleistocene deglaciation, Vermont hosted multiple paleolake systems constrained by bedrock geometry and
          spillway elevation — making it unusually well-suited for sequencing tests.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Meadow House Observatory and Paleo–Lake Winooski</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Terrace reconstruction + basin modeling suggest Paleo–Lake Winooski reached elevations that lapped Meadow House meadow margins.</li>
          <li>Quartz–amphibolite saddles behave as hydraulic regulators, routing early meltwater while preserving stable discharge pathways.</li>
          <li>Key field observables: persistent springs below high-relief quartz saddles; basin geometries consistent with early ice thinning; low seasonal variability in spring flow relative to downslope controls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Passumpsic Basin (Northern Analog)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stepped paleolakes draining northward toward St. Lawrence show terrace elevations that match Paleo–Lake Winooski bands.</li>
          <li>Lithologic continuity (quartzite + quartz-vein corridors) mirrors Worcester Range patterns: similar host lithology, saddle spacing/relief ratios, ridge-aligned spring emergence.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>2.3 Putney Stoneworks &amp; Glacial Lake Hitchcock (Southern Analog)</h3>

        <p>
        Terrace mapping and deglacial reconstructions indicate that the Putney, Vermont stonework complexes occupy a transitional
        elevation band associated with the northern extent and episodic drawdown phases of Glacial Lake Hitchcock, the proglacial
        lake that once filled the Connecticut River Valley during late Pleistocene retreat.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Key observations suggest that Putney functioned not as an isolated ceremonial site, but as part of a distributed
        hydrologic–observational system tied to lake-level regulation and meltwater routing:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hydrologic Positioning:</strong>
            The Putney stoneworks sit above primary Hitchcock shoreline terraces yet below later fluvial incision zones, consistent
            with a phase when lake levels oscillated and spillways were actively reorganizing. This placement would have afforded
            both visibility over lake surfaces and access to gravity-fed groundwater emerging from retreating ice-margin sediments.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Lithologic and Structural Continuity:</strong>
            Bedrock and erratic composition in the Putney area shows continuity with quartz-bearing metamorphic units found
            throughout the Connecticut Valley uplands. Stone placements align with ridge-parallel fabric and slope breaks that
            naturally concentrate subsurface flow, reinforcing the interpretation of intentional siting along hydrologic control
            points rather than random occupation.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Engineered Water Access:</strong>
            Field evidence suggests managed springs, channelized seepage paths, and stone-defined flow guidance consistent with
            low-energy water control rather than defensive or agricultural terracing. These features parallel known melt-phase
            hydrologic adaptations elsewhere in the valley during Hitchcock regression.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Observational Geometry:</strong>
            Several stone alignments and cleared sightlines correspond to basin-scale axes rather than local topography alone,
            suggesting an observational function oriented toward seasonal solar bearings over the lake surface and surrounding
            ridgelines. Such geometry is consistent with chronometric use during periods of stable or slowly changing lake levels.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Comparative Implication:</strong>
        Taken together with Meadow House (Paleo–Lake Winooski) and the Passumpsic Basin, the Putney–Hitchcock system demonstrates
        that chronometer-like behavior emerges repeatedly where three conditions coincide:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Quartz-rich lithology</li>
          <li>Saddle- or terrace-mediated meltwater control</li>
          <li>Prolonged deglacial lake stability followed by phased drawdown</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
        This reinforces the interpretation of Planetary Chronometers as structurally biased melt-routing and observation systems
        embedded within deglaciating landscapes, rather than as isolated or culturally idiosyncratic constructions.

        <h3>3.1 Conic Geometry & Bearings</h3>
        <p>
          Chronometer cones are defined by (i) a local observer apex, (ii) two bounding solstitial bearings (and optional
          equinox / lunar standstill envelopes), and (iii) horizon-aware corrections (DEM + refraction).
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 G = v · h² Screening Rule</h3>
        <p>
          Candidate basins are ranked using a reproducible screening metric (G = v · h²), treated as a global search
          heuristic — not a claim of “one true mechanism.”
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Acoustics:</strong> notch/gap modes (bandpass 0.5–100 Hz); log geometry + mic placement + conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrology:</strong> springs, discharge timing, seasonal logging, δ¹⁸O/δD sampling protocols.</li>
